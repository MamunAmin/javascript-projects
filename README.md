# javascript-projects

In this repo I have gathered some of my simple single page  **Vanilla Javascript** projects, inspired by the tech youtuber Florin Pop. Most of them are not responsive for mobile devices. 
You can see live all of them from - [Here](https://mamunamin.github.io/javascript-projects/)

The projects are summarized below:

 1. **Countdown Timer** - No matter what year is running now, this app will calculate the remaining time for next new year eve. - [ \[Live Here\]](https://mamunamin.github.io/javascript-projects/projects/countdown-timer/index.html)
 
 
 2. **Border Image Slider** - This app is generated an image border around a text content. It is fully responsive. On resize, image quantity and size will change  dynamically. Two random contiguous image will change position once at a time continuously. -  [\[Live Here\]](https://mamunamin.github.io/javascript-projects/projects/border-image-slider/index.html)
